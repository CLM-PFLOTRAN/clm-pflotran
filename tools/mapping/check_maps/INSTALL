BUILDING ON YELLOWSTONE
=======================

To compile this tool, you need to have the ESMFMKFILE environment variable set.
The easiest way to do that is to load the ESMF modules. To do this, you must
already have the intel module loaded. Then load the version of ESMF you want
to use (as of April 2013, the most recent version available is 6.1.1):

$ module load esmf
$ module load esmf-6.1.1-ncdfio-uni-O

This will set ESMFMKFILE. With this variable set, enter the mapping/check_maps/src/
directory and run

$ gmake

back in the mapping/check_maps/ directory, you should now have an executable
file named ESMF_RegridWeightGenCheck.

Note that at this time, the tool only works in serial mode (building with the 
mpi-enabled version of the ESMF makefile leads to a segmentation fault when
running with more than one MPI task).
