I.) For clm4_0:

Configure Modes NOT scientifically validated, documented, supported or even advised to be used:
(options to CLM_CONFIG_OPTS)

   SNICAR_FRC 	(-snicar_frc)
       This mode is tested and functional, but is NOT constantly scientifcally validated, and should be 
       considered experimental.

Namelist items that should NOT be exercised:

  suplnitro='ALL'        (suplnitro='ALL' with -bgc cn)
                         The suplemental Nitrogen mode of the CN model is known 
                         to be too productive.
  urban_traffic:         Not currently functional

II.) For clm4_5:

Configure Modes NOT scientifically validated, documented, supported or even advised to be used:

    VIC		      (-vichydro)
        VIC hydrology has just been added, and this mode is experimental.

    EXTRALAKELAYERS   (-exlaklayers)

Namelist items that should NOT be exercised:

See KnownBugs/KnownLimitations files for Known Problems:

    See the KnownBugs file in this directory for the list of known problems. We expect
    that eventually we will fix the bugs in this list. In the KnownLimitations file
    we list limitations in the code that we have workarounds for that we do NOT expect
    to fix.
