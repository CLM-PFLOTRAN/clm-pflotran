CLM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if applicable:

Changes answers relative to baseline:

IF tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations:
    - what platforms/compilers:
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename:
